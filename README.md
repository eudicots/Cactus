### Cactus 3 is out!

We're happy to announce Cactus 3. It brings a set of great new features like asset fingerprinting, an asset pipeline, pretty urls, native Mac filesystem events, automatic nameserver configuration, support for multiple deployment backends (Google Sites) and more. Large parts of the code have been rewritten, accompanied by an extensive suite of unit tests. Many thanks to Thomas Orozco and other contributors.


What is Cactus
--------------

Cactus is a simple but powerful [static website generator][1] using Python and the [Django template system][2].
Cactus also makes it easy to develop locally and deploy your site to S3 directly.
It works great for company, portfolio, personal, support websites and blogs.

To get a quick overview [watch this short video tutorial][3].

Cactus is based on the idea that most dynamic features on websites these days can be done using Javascript while the
actual site can stay static. Static websites are easy to host and typically very fast.

I developed Cactus because I wanted a standard, easy system that designers at [Sofa](http://www.madebysofa.com) could
use to build and deploy fast websites. So typical users would be designers that are tech-savvy, want to use templates,
but don't like to mess with setting up django or S3.

Since then it has evolved quite a bit with a plugin system that supports blogging, spriting, versioning and is
extensible.

You can find more discussion about static site generators in this [Hacker News discussion][4].

Super quick tutorial for the impatient
--------------------------------------

Install Cactus with the following one liner

    sudo easy_install cactus

If you saw no errors, you can now generate a new project

    cactus create ~/www.mysite.com

To start editing and previewing your site type the following. Then point your browser to localhost:8000 and start editing. Cactus will automatically rebuild your project and refresh your browser on changes.

    cd ~/www.mysite.com
    cactus serve

Once you are ready to deploy your site to S3 you can run the following. You will need your [Amazon access keys][5].
If you don't have one yet, [read how to get one here][6].

    cactus deploy

Voila. Your website generated by Cactus and hosted on S3!


Extended guide

### Creating a new project

You can create a new project by generating a new project structure like this. Make sure the destination folder does not
exist yet.

    cactus create [path]

If you did not see any errors, the path you pointed to should now look like this.

    - .build                Generated site (upload this to your host)
    - pages                 Your actual site pages
        - index.html
        - sitemap.xml
        - robots.txt
        - error.html        A default 404 page
    - templates             Holds your django templates
        - base.html
    - static                Directory with static assets
        - images
        - css
        - js
    - plugins               A list of plugins. To enable remove disabled from the name


### Making your site

After generating your site you can start building by adding pages to contents, which can rely on templates. So for
example if you want a page `/articles/2010/my-article.html` you would create the file with directories in your pages
folder. Then you can edit the file and use django's template features.


### Building your site

When you build your site it will generate a static version in the build folder that you can upload to any host.
Basically it will render each page from your pages folder, copy it over to the build folder and add all the static
assets to it so it becomes a self contained website. You can build your site like this:

    cd [your-cactus-path]
    cactus build

Your rendered website can now be found in the (hidden) [path]/.build folder. Cactus can also run a small webserver to
preview your site and update it when you make any changes. This is really handy when developing to get live visual feedback.

You can run it like this:

    cactus serve

### Linking and contexts

Cactus makes it easy to relatively link to pages and static assets inside your project by using the template tags
{% static %} and {% url %}. For example if you are at page `/blog/2011/Jan/my-article.html` and would like to link to
`/contact.html` you would write the following:

    <a href="{% url '/contact.html' %}">Contact</a>

Just use the URL you would normally use: don't forget the leading slash.

You can add extra context to your pages. Just insert it on the top of the file like this:

    name: koen
    age: 29
    {% extends "base.html" %}
    â€¦

which will be converted to a dict: `{'name': 'koen', 'age': '29'}` and added to the context. 
If the first line of your document should contain a colon, 
you can use the more explicit style of metadata [as used in Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/):

    ---
    Author: Me
    Style:  Great
    ---
    Todays motto: whatever

Always use `---` (three dashes) to fence the metadata.

### Templates

Cactus uses the Django templates. They should be very similar to other templating systems and have some nice
capabilities like inheritance. In a nutshell: a variable looks like this `{{ name }}` and a tag like this
`{% block title %}Welcome{% endblock %}`. You can read the [full documentation][7] at the django site.


### Enabling Plugins

To enable a plugin for your site, change the file name from [PLUGIN].disabled.py to [PLUGIN].py.
For an example of how to build a blog on top of Cactus, see [CactusBlog](https://github.com/koenbok/CactusBlog/)


### Deploying

Cactus can deploy your website directly to S3, all you need are your Amazon credentials and a bucket name. Cactus
remembers these in a configuration file name config.json to make future deploys painless. The secret key is stored
securely in the Keychain or similar services on other OSs.

    cactus deploy

After deploying you can visit the website directly. Cactus also makes sure all your text files are compressed and adds caching headers.


### Extras


#### Asset pipeline

Cactus comes with an asset pipeline for your static files. If you'd like to use it, make sure you use the {% static %}
template tag to link to your static assets: they might be renamed in the process.


##### Fingerprinting

Modify `config.json`, and add the extensions you want to be fingerprinting:

    "fingerprint": [
        "js",
        "css"
    ],

This lets you enable caching with long expiration dates. When a file changes, its name will reflect the change. Great for when you use a CDN.


##### Optimization

Modify `config.json`, and add the extensions you want to be optimizing:

    "optimize": [
        "js",
        "css"
    ],


By default, Cactus will use:

  + YUI for CSS minification
  + Closure compiler for JS minification (YUI is built-in too, so you can use it!)

Check out `plugins/static_optimizes.py` in your project to understand how this works. It's very easy to add your own
optimizers!


#### Site URL

If you would like for your sitemap to have absolute paths you need to
add a site-url key to your config.json

You can enable this by adding modifying your configuration and adding:

    "site-url": "http://yoursite.com",

Note that you need to do this if you want your sitemap to be valid for Google Webmaster Tools.


#### "Pretty" URLs

If you would like to not have ".html" in your URLs, Cactus can rewrite those for you, and make "/my-page.html" look
appear as "/my-page/", by creating the "/my-page/index.html" file.

You can enable this by adding modifying your configuration and adding:

    "prettify": true

Note that if you're going to use this, you should definitely set your "Meta canonical" to the URL you're using so as
to not hurt your search rankings:

    <link rel="canonical" href="{{ CURRENT_PAGE.absolute_final_url }}" />


#### Nameserver configuration

To set up a hosted zone and generate the correct nameserver records for your domain, make sure your bucket is a valid domain name, and run:

    cactus domain:setup

Cactus will return with a set of nameservers that you can then enter with your registrar. To see the list again run:

    cactus domain:list

If your domain is 'naked' (eg. without www), Cactus will add create an extra bucket that redirects the www variant of your domain to your naked domain (so www.cactus.com to cactus.com). All the above is Amazon only for now.


#### Extra files

Cactus will auto generate a `robots.txt` and `sitemap.xml` file for you based on your pages.

This will help bots to index your pages for Google and Bing for example.
